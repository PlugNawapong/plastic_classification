# Industrial-Standard 1D CNN for Plastic Classification

A robust implementation of the **P1CH (Pixel-wise 1D Convolutional Hyperspectral) Classifier** for pixel-level plastic material classification using hyperspectral imaging.

Based on the research paper: *"A Deep Learning Approach for Pixel-level Material Classification via Hyperspectral Imaging"*

## Features

- **Industrial-strength architecture**: Lightweight 1D CNN with residual blocks
- **Pixel-level classification**: Achieves high accuracy on 11 plastic material classes
- **Advanced training**: Adam optimizer with cosine annealing and warmup
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Confusion matrix, per-class metrics, Cohen's Kappa
- **Post-processing**: Morphological filtering for cleaner segmentation
- **Inference pipeline**: Full workflow for production deployment

## Architecture

The P1CH classifier uses:
- 2 Conv1D layers (16, 32 filters) with max pooling
- 2 Residual blocks (64, 128 filters) with batch normalization
- Fully connected layers (512 neurons) with dropout
- Softmax output for 11 classes

**Total parameters**: ~1M (lightweight and efficient)

## Understanding the Methods

### Adam Optimizer

**Adam** (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines the best of two optimization methods:
- **Momentum**: Smooths gradient updates by using moving averages
- **RMSprop**: Adapts learning rate per parameter

**Benefits**: Fast convergence, works well with noisy gradients, minimal tuning needed

### Cosine Annealing with Warmup

Learning rate schedule in two phases:

1. **Warmup (Epochs 1-10)**: Linear increase from low→high LR
   - Stabilizes training at the start
   - Prevents divergence with random initialization

2. **Cosine Annealing (Epochs 10-50)**: Smooth decrease high→low LR
   - Helps escape local minima
   - Fine-tunes weights as LR decreases
   - Better final accuracy than fixed LR

### Preprocessing Methods

#### Paper's Method (Baseline)
```python
# Simple max normalization
normalized = (spectral_cube - black_reference) / max_value
```

#### Improved Method (Recommended)
```python
# Brightness boost + Percentile + Band-wise
preprocessor = HyperspectralPreprocessor(
    method='percentile',        # Robust to outliers
    brightness_boost=True,      # Enhance signal
    band_wise=True,             # Normalize each band independently ⭐
    percentile_low=1,           # Clip bottom 1%
    percentile_high=99          # Clip top 1%
)
```

**Why band-wise normalization?**
- Different spectral bands have vastly different intensity ranges
- Some bands may be dim, others bright
- Band-wise normalization equalizes all bands
- **Expected improvement**: 2-5% accuracy boost

### Postprocessing (From Paper)

Applied to prediction maps to reduce noise:

1. **Median Filter** (kernel=5): Removes salt-and-pepper classification errors
2. **Morphological Opening**: Removes small isolated misclassified regions
3. **Morphological Closing**: Fills small gaps in objects

**Result**: Accuracy improves from 97.44% → 99.94% (excluding borders)

### Is PCA Necessary?

**PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** reduces 459 bands → 50-100 bands

**Pros**:
- Faster training/inference (5-10x speedup)
- Lower memory usage
- Can remove noise
- Retains 90-95% variance

**Cons**:
- Loss of spectral information
- Extra preprocessing complexity
- May reduce peak accuracy

**Recommendation**:
- ✓ Try WITHOUT PCA first (baseline)
- ⚠️ Add PCA only if training is too slow or memory-constrained
- 🎯 For production with real-time requirements, PCA is beneficial

## Quick Start

### Compare Preprocessing Methods

**Important**: Understand the preprocessing differences before training!

```bash
# Complete comparison: Paper vs Global vs Band-wise
python compare_all_methods.py
```

This generates:
- `complete_comparison.png` - Visual comparison of all 3 methods across bands
- `histogram_all_methods.png` - Distribution analysis
- Detailed statistics showing why band-wise is superior

**Key Finding**: Dim spectral bands use only 2-5% of [0,1] range with paper's method, but 95-100% with band-wise! This is why band-wise gives 2-5% accuracy boost.

### 1. Training

Train the model from scratch:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Load hyperspectral data (459 spectral bands)
- Train for 50 epochs with cosine annealing
- Save checkpoints to `checkpoints/`
- Log training curves to TensorBoard

**Monitor training** with TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/
```

### 2. Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This will:
- Load the best checkpoint
- Calculate comprehensive metrics
- Generate confusion matrix
- Plot per-class accuracy/precision
- Visualize training history

### 3. Inference

Run inference on test datasets:

```bash
python inference.py
```

This will:
- Process all 3 inference datasets
- Apply post-processing (median filter + morphological operations)
- Save RGB segmentation maps
- Generate class distribution statistics

## Configuration

### Training Hyperparameters

Edit `train.py` config:

    'lr_min': 0.0001,             # Minimum learning rate
    'warmup_epochs': 10,          # Warmup period
    'total_epochs': 50,           # Total training epochs
    'dropout_rate': 0.5,          # Dropout for regularization
    'train_split': 0.9,           # Train/val split
}
```

    model,
    apply_postprocessing=True  # Enable/disable
)

prediction_map = pipeline.postprocess(
    prediction_map,
    median_kernel=5,   # Median filter size
    morph_kernel=3     # Morphological kernel size
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory
- Reduce `batch_size` in config
- Set `max_samples` to limit dataset size
- Use CPU if GPU memory is insufficient
